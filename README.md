# Patrimonium

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

## Description
Patrimonium is a web application built with Angular that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete posts and users. The application is designed to promote the protection of cultural and natural heritage while improving social and environmental ties. It uses a Bearer token authentication system to access GoRest's REST APIs.

## Features
Login: The login page accepts only a token that must be obtained by visiting GoRest Login. Once acquired, the token is used to authenticate API requests.

Main Page â€“ Users List: Displays a list of users with basic information. Users can be added or removed. Additionally, search and pagination features are available.

User Details Page: Displays detailed information for a single user, their posts, and comments related to each post. Users can also add comments.

Posts List: Displays all posts with the ability to add new posts, search posts by title or body, and view comments for each post.

Tests and Code Quality: The project includes unit tests with a coverage of at least 60%.

Logout: Includes a logout feature that removes the token and disconnects the user.

Lazy Loading and Multi-modules: The application is structured into multiple modules with lazy loading for better performance and code management.
